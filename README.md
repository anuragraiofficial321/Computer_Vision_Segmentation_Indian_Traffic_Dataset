## Semantic Segmentation of Indian Traffic Images using U-Net Convolutional Neural Network

- The specific focus of this project is to perform semantic segmentation on Indian Traffic Images. These images are obtained from video footage captured at various traffic sites in different cities of India. The objective is to accurately segment and classify each pixel in the images based on the object class it belongs to, such as vehicles, pedestrians, road, buildings, etc.

- To achieve this, the project utilizes the U-Net architecture, which is a convolutional neural network (CNN) model designed for image segmentation tasks. The U-Net architecture is known for its ability to capture both local details and global context, making it effective for pixel-level predictions. It uses an encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder learns to extract hierarchical features from the input image, and the decoder reconstructs the segmentation map.

- By employing the U-Net-based CNN model, the project aims to accurately segment and classify different regions in the Indian Traffic Images, providing valuable insights and understanding of the traffic scenes in various Indian cities. This information can be used for traffic management, urban planning, and other applications aimed at improving traffic flow and safety
